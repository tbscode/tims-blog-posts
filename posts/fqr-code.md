Frequency Quick Response (FQR) Codes enable sending small to medium-sized files by converting data into a sequence of QR codes.

This sequence is displayed by an app on the sender's device and captured by the receiver's camera — no network connection required.

Because transfer happens via QR codes, an FQR sequence can also be printed, passed on paper, and re-scanned later. For example, small flipbooks can be used as physical data carriers and distributed as a novel brochure format.

One major advantage of FQR is that it does not require a connection like Wi‑Fi, Bluetooth, or cellular, which might incur costs or be unavailable. In areas without mobile coverage — or when large files would deplete data plans — FQR can be a faster and more practical alternative on smartphones.

Like traditional QR codes on paper, FQR codes can be shown on screens — in broadcasts or shop windows — to transfer additional materials directly to users' devices.
