Retro Escape is a simple but challenging puzzle game. Guide a character from the start to the end tile while navigating walls, collecting items in the right order, and using them appropriately to solve each level.

However, that's not all â€” programmable blocks and recursive objects unlock new puzzle concepts and level designs.

Not only can you challenge your mind by solving tricky levels, you can also use your creativity to build unique ones. The built-in level editor includes all game blocks and offers a simple script language to interface with the programmable blocks. Created levels can be saved or shared via file and QR code.

The game was developed cross-platform using the LibGDX framework. It was written in Kotlin and uses the ZXING library for QR code detection. An Android beta was released featuring 30 levels.
